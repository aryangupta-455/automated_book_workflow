# automated_book_workflow

# DAY 1
Today, I created a script using Playwright in VS Code to scrape chapter content and capture a screenshot from the specified Wikisource page. The script successfully extracts the text and saves a full-page image of the chapter. I will now push the completed work to the GitHub repository and consider Day 1's objectives achieved.

# DAY 2
Today, I implemented the AI-driven rewriting ("spinning") of the scraped chapter text using the OpenAI GPT model. The workflow includes sending the extracted content to the model via the OpenAI API and receiving a rephrased version styled in a more modern, engaging tone. The rewritten output is saved locally for further review and editing. This forms the foundation for the AI Writer agent in the automated book workflow pipeline.

âœ… Tasks completed:

Integrated OpenAI API for content generation

Developed script to spin chapter text

Stored rewritten output for future human-in-the-loop feedback
