# automated_book_workflow

# DAY 1
Today, I created a script using Playwright in VS Code to scrape chapter content and capture a screenshot from the specified Wikisource page. The script successfully extracts the text and saves a full-page image of the chapter. I will now push the completed work to the GitHub repository and consider Day 1's objectives achieved.

# DAY 2
Today, I implemented the AI-driven rewriting ("spinning") of the scraped chapter text using the OpenAI GPT model. The workflow includes sending the extracted content to the model via the OpenAI API and receiving a rephrased version styled in a more modern, engaging tone. The rewritten output is saved locally for further review and editing. This forms the foundation for the AI Writer agent in the automated book workflow pipeline.

âœ… Tasks completed:

Integrated OpenAI API for content generation

Developed script to spin chapter text

Stored rewritten output for future human-in-the-loop feedback

# DAY 3
Today, I implemented a basic CLI-based human-in-the-loop interface to review and finalize AI-generated content. The script displays the original, AI-spun, and AI-reviewed versions of the chapter, and prompts the user to either accept the reviewed version or manually edit it before saving.

âœ… Tasks Completed:

Created human_interface/editor.py to handle user review and editing

Enhanced app_day2.py to integrate human feedback into the AI workflow

Enabled a simple decision flow: accept reviewed or edit manually

Saved the finalized version to final_version.txt for version tracking

ðŸ§ª Features Implemented:

Preview first 500 characters of each version for quick comparison

CLI prompt to guide the user's decision

Manual editing supported via standard input (CTRL+D/CTRL+Z to finish)


# DAY 4
Today, I integrated ChromaDB to handle versioning and persistent storage of the different content states in the automated book workflow. This allows efficient storage and retrieval of:

The original scraped text

AI-spun version

AI-reviewed version

Final human-approved version

This structure enables intelligent querying and retrieval later in the pipeline (supporting RL-based search in upcoming steps).

âœ… Tasks Completed:

Installed and configured ChromaDB as a local vector database

Stored all content versions (original, spun, reviewed, final) as documents with metadata

Implemented basic retrieval interface to fetch stored versions for inspection or reuse

ðŸ§ª Features Implemented:

Consistent version tracking across each processing stage

Use of document IDs and metadata (e.g. version type, timestamp)

Verified storage and retrieval via test script
